# Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in 'The Office' Sitcom Project
**Python project on DataCamp course which have 2 parts, there are guided and unguided project.**

## Descriptions
In this project, I'm applying the skills I learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. I'm pressing “watch next episode” to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office" sitcom, using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

It also help me to gain experience in an essential data science skill such as exploratory data analysis. This allowed me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots I created of the data.

## Projects
### [Guided Project](https://github.com/diandwik/Investigating-Netflix/tree/main/Guided)

*Dig into a real-world Netflix movie dataset using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.*

#### Project Tasks
1. Loading your friend's data into a dictionary
2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
3. A visual inspection of our data
4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV
5. Filtering for movies!
6. Creating a scatter plot
7. Digging deeper
8. Marking non-feature films
9. Plotting with color!
10. What next?

### [Unguided Project](https://github.com/diandwik/Investigating-Netflix/tree/main/Unguided)

*In this project, I initiate the process by creating an informative plot of the episode data provided. In doing so, I'm going to work on several different variables, including the episode number, the viewership, the fan rating, and guest appearances.*

### Project Tasks

1. Create a matplotlib scatter plot of the data that contains the following attributes:
   - Each episode's episode number plotted along the x-axis
   - Each episode's viewership (in millions) plotted along the y-axis
   - A color scheme reflecting the scaled ratings (not the regular ratings) of each episode, such that:
     + Ratings < 0.25 are colored "red"
     + Ratings >= 0.25 and < 0.50 are colored "orange"
     + Ratings >= 0.50 and < 0.75 are colored "lightgreen"
     + Ratings >= 0.75 are colored "darkgreen"
   - A sizing system, such that episodes with guest appearances have a marker size of 250 and episodes without are sized 25
   - A title, reading "Popularity, Quality, and Guest Appearances on the Office"
   - An x-axis label reading "Episode Number"
   - A y-axis label reading "Viewership (Millions)"
   
2. Provide the name of one of the guest stars who was in the most watched Office episode.
